# A example about binary option trading and smart contract ERC20, ERC721

> If you start project and register a account, pls fill OTP is 1111
> Because this one is an example project which i learn and practice about Angular and Smart contract. how does it work!. and I don't have many times for it. so maybe there are many bugs in project about frontend and backend also. but when I have time i will refactor it again.
> Thanks for your understanding. Stay tuned!
